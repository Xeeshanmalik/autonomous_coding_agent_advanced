# Agent Coordination Log

Append-only. See AGENTS.md §9 for entry format and rules.

## 2026-05-21T00:00:00Z | dir | BRANCH_CREATED

AGENTS.md and agent_log.md initialized on `main`.
All agents: read AGENTS.md before opening any branch or PR.
Dependency graph and merge order are defined in AGENTS.md §6.

## 2026-05-21T00:01:00Z | dir | UNBLOCKED

Three service agents instantiated. Per-service CLAUDE.md files created:
- `autoresearch_agent/CLAUDE.md` → ara agent, Phases 1–10
- `frontend/CLAUDE.md`           → fe agent, Phase 11
- `inference_server/CLAUDE.md`   → inf agent, Dockerfile maintenance

Root `CLAUDE.md` created with shared hard rules.
AGENTS.md updated with the three-service agent roster.

ara, fe, inf: you are now unblocked. Read your CLAUDE.md and begin Phase work
in priority order from implementation.md.

PR #2: config(inf): add --parallel 4 to llama-server
https://github.com/Xeeshanmalik/autonomous_coding_agent_advanced/pull/2
Adds --parallel 4 to ENTRYPOINT so Phase 1 K=3 concurrent candidates are served in parallel.

## 2026-05-22T00:00:00Z | ara | BRANCH_CREATED

Branch `agent/ara/phase-1-parallel-candidates` created from `main`.
Phase 1 — Parallel Candidate Generation. Adds `run_in_sandbox`, `run_candidate_pool`,
`CandidateResult` dataclass, and `CANDIDATE_POOL_SIZE` constant to `autoresearch.py`.
Replaces single-candidate inner loop with K-parallel sandbox evaluation.
Depends on: none. Blocks: Phase 2 (pop), Phase 8 (hlr).

## 2026-05-22T00:00:00Z | fe | BRANCH_CREATED

Branch `agent/fe/phase-11-loss-sparkline` created from `main`.
Phase 11 work begins: __EVENT__ stream parsing, lossHistory SVG sparkline, client-side Myers diff + Champion tab.
NOTE: Phase 9 (ara) not yet merged. PR will be held until ara logs MERGE_COMPLETED for Phase 9.

## 2026-05-22T00:01:00Z | fe | PR_OPENED

PR #4 opened: "[Phase 11] Frontend improvements — loss sparkline + champion diff tab"

## 2026-05-22T00:02:00Z | ara | BRANCH_CREATED

Branch `agent/ara/phase-5-adaptive-temperature` created from `main`.
Phase 5 — Adaptive Temperature + Exploration Schedule.
Adds `temp` parameter to `query_llm`; computes cosine annealing base_temp per cycle
(0.8→0.1); derives per-candidate spread [low=0.5×, mid=1×, high=1.5×] for pool.
Depends on: none. Blocks: Phase 2 (together with Phase 1 merge).

## 2026-05-22T00:12:00Z | ara | BRANCH_CREATED

Branch `agent/ara/phase-6-checkpointing` created from `main`.
Phase 6 — State Persistence & Resumability.
Adds `save_checkpoint`, `load_checkpoint`, `git_commit_champion` to `autoresearch.py`.
`main()` checks for `checkpoint.json` on startup and resumes; saves checkpoint after
every cycle; commits `train.py` to git after each breakthrough.
Depends on: none. Blocks: none.

## 2026-05-22T00:14:00Z | ara | BRANCH_CREATED

Branch `agent/ara/phase-9-server-process-mgmt` created from `main`.
Phase 9 — Process Management in Server (Cancel + Isolation).
server.py: per-request UUID workdir, `active_runs` registry, `preexec_fn=os.setsid`,
`__RUN_ID__` first stream line, `POST /cancel/{run_id}` via SIGTERM to process group.
autoresearch.py: `_handle_sigterm` flag + loop exit check.
Depends on: none. Blocks: fe (cancel button wiring, run_id capture).

## 2026-05-22T00:15:00Z | ara | PR_OPENED

PR #9 opened for Phase 9 — Server Process Management, Cancel Endpoint, Isolation.
URL: https://github.com/Xeeshanmalik/autonomous_coding_agent_advanced/pull/9
Depends on: none. Blocks: fe (cancel button + run_id wiring).
Awaiting Research Director review.

---

## 2026-05-22T06:00:00Z | fe | MERGE_COMPLETED

PR #4 merged: [Phase 11] Frontend improvements — loss sparkline + champion diff tab.
Phase 11 is the only fe-assigned phase. All fe phases are now complete.
NOTE: When Phase 9 (ara — process management) merges, fe will need a follow-up update:
  - Parse run_id from first streamed line (server will emit it per Phase 9 spec)
  - Store run_id in state
  - Update handleStop() to POST /cancel/{run_id} instead of just closing the reader
  fe will create branch agent/fe/phase-9-cancel-integration at that time.
